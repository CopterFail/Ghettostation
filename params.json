","body":"### Welcome to OPEN FPV STATION.\r\nWhat is the OPEN FPV STATION good for and who can use it?\r\nI want to use a monitor or a goggle to do FPV. An OSD should show the status of the battery, \r\nthe distance, height, direction, GPS coordinates of the model. The system has to be low cost.\r\nI want a good video quality, while the video transmission power is limited. A solution is to \r\nuse a directional antenna with high gain. The station has to point the antenna to the modell. \r\nSo we need servos to turn the antenna and the information where the modell actually is. \r\nThe modell has a GPS on board, but how does the station get this GPS information? Many RC systems \r\nallow to send telemetry data from the modell back to the RC transmitter - so does my Graupner MX12 / \r\nGR12s. The telemetriy is called HoTT telemetry. The flight controller (e.g. CleanFlight) reads \r\nthe GPS and sends the telemetry data to RC receiver, the receiver send the data to the transmitter, \r\nthe transmitter shows the data on it's display and can send it by usb or bluetooth (see the mod) \r\nto the station. The station turns the antenna and use the telemetry data for the osd.\r\n\r\n###Used hardware:\r\n - Graupner MX12 HoTT with Bluetooth mod (I use the HoTT telemetrie protocol, others are possible)\r\n - TEENSY3.1\r\n - HC-05 Bluetooth module for the station, configured as master\r\n - HC-06 Bluetooth module for the MX12 (slave, other modules can be used)\r\n - ST7735 LCD display (color, 128x160 pixel)\r\n - 2 x RX5808 with SPI mod\r\n - 2 x Antenna\r\n - 2 x Servo\r\n - 5V voltage regulator\r\n - minimosd\r\n - 3 x Button \r\n\r\n###Project status:\r\n - The station can be used, but is experimental\r\n - Tracking is ok\r\n - HoTT link is ok\r\n - Video receiver manual selection, channel scan and selection is ok\r\n - Diversity works\r\n\r\n###Credits:\r\nSample codes & inspirations from different origins:\r\n- bluetooth in HoTT TX (http://fpv-community.de/showthread.p...l=1#post354274)\r\n- HoTT smartbox/bt discussion \r\n  (http://fpv-community.de/showthread.php?50949-HoTT-Protokoll-via-Smartbox-oder-BT-Modul)\r\n- ghettostation (https://github.com/KipK/Ghettostation) from KipK's \r\n- minimosd-extra (http://code.google.com/p/minimosd-extra/)\r\n- many more...\r\n\r\n ","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
